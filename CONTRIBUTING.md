# How to contribute

Third-party patches are essential for keeping RichFaces great. Contributing
to the project helps to deliver functionality you need and allows you to share
your code with other contributors and users. We want to keep it as easy as possible
to contribute changes you made and we will work hard to deliver your contributions
in upcoming releases. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.
