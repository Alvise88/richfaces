    <p>
        When a suggestion request is sent to the server via an Ajax call you have full control over the suggestion list. Once
        that data is on the client the default filter is <i>startsWith</i>. This can be changed to any custom JavaScript filter
        you wish. This example shows you how to define and call a custom filter for <i>contains</i> instead of <i>startsWith</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>clientFilterFunction</b> attribute accepts a custom JavaScript function name. This function should have two
        parameters; <b>subString</b>(current input value considering tokens) and <b>value</b> (currently iterated item value)
        and return boolean flag which means if the value satisfies the substring passed. The function will be called for every
        available suggestion in order to construct a new list of suggestions.
