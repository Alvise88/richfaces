        The <b>r:jQuery</b> component integrates the jQuery JavaScript framework into your application. This include being
        able to apply the styles and behavior to the DOM elements dynamically, including the result of JSF components rendering.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>selector</b> attribute defines an object or list of objects that the query defined with the query attribute will
        be applied to. The <b>query</b> attribute should be defined with valid JavaScript statements or jQuery api calls
    </p>

    <p>r:jQuery can be used in these modes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As a one time query applied immediately or on a document ready event.</li>
        <li>Define an event handler which is bound to elements returned by selector on some event.</li>
        <li>As a JavaScript function that can be invoked from custom JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This example shows how to attach events to the mouseover/mouseout event on the DOM objects. The source below will
        show how to make them enlarged.</p>
