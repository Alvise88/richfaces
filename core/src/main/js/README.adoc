= A grunt.js project used to build RichWidgets for inclusion in RichFaces

== Usage

Run `grunt` with one of the following tasks:

clean:bower:: Removes the `bower_components` folder completely
exec:bowerInstall:: runs `bower install`, installing the _richwidgets_ dependency into `bower_components`
subgrunt:richwidgets:: runs `npm install` in the richwidgets subproject, followed by `grunt bower dist`
copy-resources:: copies the RichWidgets dist resources into the src/resources/META-INF/resources folder
dist:: (default task) Runs all the above grunt tasks.  *Should be executed prior to releases*.

== Committing your changes

After you update the RichWidgets resources into the framework source tree, you will need to commit those resource changes.
Choose a commit message explaining what necessitated the widget resource update (ie. which upstream changes are you trying to include).
