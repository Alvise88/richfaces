                The CDK includes a code-generation facility and a
                templating facility using a JSP-like syntax. These
                capabilities help to avoid a routine process of a
                component creation. The component factory works like
                a well-oiled machine allowing the creation of
                first-class rich components with built-in Ajax
                functionality even more easily than the creation of
                simpler components by means of the traditional
                coding approach.
